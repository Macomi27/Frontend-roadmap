// The Sources panel
// The Sources panel has 3 parts:
// The File Navigator pane lists HTML, JavaScript, CSS and other files, including images that are attached to the page. Chrome extensions may appear here too.
// The Code Editor pane shows the source code.
// The JavaScript Debugging pane is for debugging.

// Breakpoints
// To enable a breakpoint  click at line number in the Code Editor pane.

// Code can also be paused using the command "debugger"

// Tracing the execution
//  – “Resume”: continue the execution, hotkey F8.
//  – “Step”: run the next command, hotkey F9.
//  – “Step over”: run the next command, but don’t go into a function, hotkey F10.
//  – “Step into”, hotkey F11.
//  – “Step out”: continue the execution till the end of the current function, hotkey Shift+F11.

// Logging
// The console.log() function is used to log messages to the console.

// Summary
// There are three main ways to pause a script:
// A breakpoint.
// The debugger statements.
// An error (if dev tools are open and the button  is “on”).
// When paused, we can debug: examine variables and trace the code to see where the execution goes wrong.
